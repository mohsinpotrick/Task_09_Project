## Working Prototype Report

### Overview
By Week 8, a functional prototype was developed that demonstrates the
end-to-end insurance cost analysis pipeline. The prototype accepts
structured user inputs, applies a validated log-linear regression model,
and produces interpretable cost estimates and explanatory outputs.

### Core Functionality
- Model training and prediction operate end-to-end
- Predictions are generated using reusable backend logic
- Outputs include dollar estimates and key cost drivers

### Data Pipeline Status
The primary data pipeline remains fully operational, including:
- Raw data ingestion
- Data cleaning and encoding
- Statistical modeling
- Evaluation and interpretation

### Interface and Output
The prototype establishes a basic interface through structured Python
dictionaries and tabular outputs. This interface is suitable for future
expansion into a web or dashboard-based application.

### Status
The project meets the Week 8 requirement of a functional working
prototype with clear inputs, outputs, and reproducible behavior.
